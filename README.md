Algorithm Overview: Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by dividing the list into two parts — a sorted section and an unsorted section. Initially, the sorted section contains only the first element of the array, and with each iteration, the algorithm takes the next element from the unsorted section and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted portion. This process continues until all elements have been placed correctly.

The logic behind Insertion Sort is similar to the way humans arrange playing cards in their hands: start with an empty hand (the sorted section) and insert each new card (element) into its proper place by comparing it with the cards already held.

Formally, given an array A of size n, the algorithm iterates from the second element (i = 1) to the last element (i = n−1). For each element, it stores the value temporarily (key = A[i]) and compares it with the previous elements. If a larger element is found, it is shifted one position to the right to make space for the key. The key is then inserted into its correct sorted position.

While Insertion Sort is not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, it has important educational and practical value. It is adaptive, performing efficiently on small or nearly sorted data, and stable, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements. Its in-place nature also ensures low memory usage, as it does not require additional data structures beyond a few variables.

Insertion Sort’s straightforward logic makes it a common choice for teaching the fundamentals of sorting algorithms and algorithmic thinking. Moreover, it is often used as a subroutine within more complex algorithms such as Hybrid Sorts for optimizing performance on small partitions of data.

Complexity Analysis

1. Time Complexity

Insertion Sort’s time complexity depends heavily on the initial order of the input data. The algorithm performs by inserting each new element into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array, which can vary from very efficient (for sorted data) to very inefficient (for reversed data).
	1)Best Case — Ω(n):
The best case occurs when the array is already sorted or nearly sorted. In this scenario, each element only needs to be compared once with its immediate predecessor, as no shifts or swaps are necessary. Therefore, the number of operations grows linearly with the input size n, giving a time complexity of Ω(n). This behavior is due to the minimal number of comparisons and absence of element shifts.
	2)Average Case — Θ(n²):
On average, the array elements are in random order. For every insertion, approximately half of the previously sorted elements must be compared and possibly shifted. The total number of operations across all insertions can be represented as the sum of an arithmetic series:
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{i}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{4}
Ignoring constant factors, this leads to an average-case complexity of Θ(n²). Thus, as the dataset doubles, the number of operations grows roughly fourfold.
	3)Worst Case — O(n²):
The worst case arises when the input array is sorted in reverse order. Here, every element has to be compared and shifted until it reaches the beginning of the sorted portion. The total number of operations becomes proportional to the sum of the first n-1 integers:
1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n-1) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
As a result, the worst-case time complexity is O(n²), which makes the algorithm inefficient for large datasets.


2. Space Complexity

Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require any additional memory beyond a few auxiliary variables for holding temporary values.
	1)Space Complexity: O(1)
The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra memory regardless of the input size.
	2)This efficiency in memory usage makes Insertion Sort particularly suitable for systems with limited resources or when the dataset fits entirely in memory.


3. Number of Comparisons

In the worst-case scenario, every new element must be compared with all preceding elements in the sorted portion of the array. This results in approximately:
\frac{n(n-1)}{2}
comparisons.

In the best case, where the array is already sorted, only n-1 comparisons are made.

Hence, we can summarize:
	1)Best Case: Ω(n) comparisons
	2)Average Case: Θ(n²/4) comparisons
	3)Worst Case: O(n²/2) comparisons

This shows that comparisons grow quadratically with input size as disorder increases.


4. Number of Swaps and Array Accesses
  1)Swaps:
Each element is moved to its correct position by shifting other elements to make room. At most, each element might be shifted once per iteration, resulting in approximately O(n²) total moves in the worst case. However, the number of actual swaps is relatively smaller than in Bubble Sort, making Insertion Sort slightly more efficient for small data.
	2)Array Accesses:
Each comparison and each movement involves accessing elements in the array. Since both comparisons and shifts increase quadratically in the worst case, the number of array accesses also follows O(n²) growth.


5. Comparison with Other Algorithms

Compared to more advanced sorting algorithms:
	1)Merge Sort and Quick Sort achieve an average complexity of O(n log n), making them more efficient for large datasets.
	2)Bubble Sort also has O(n²) complexity but typically performs more swaps than Insertion Sort.
	3)Therefore, Insertion Sort occupies a middle ground — faster than Bubble Sort on small inputs, but much slower than Divide-and-Conquer algorithms like Merge or Quick Sort on large ones.

Code Review

1. Code Structure and Functionality Overview

The provided implementation of Insertion Sort is divided into three classes that work together to measure and evaluate the algorithm’s performance:
	•	InsertionSort class — contains the core sorting logic with instrumentation for performance tracking.
	•	BenchmarkRunner class — manages the benchmarking process by generating random input arrays of different sizes, executing the sorting algorithm, and storing results in a CSV file.
	•	PerformanceTracker class — records runtime metrics including the number of comparisons, swaps, array accesses, and total execution time.

The modular separation of these components demonstrates strong software design practices. It isolates the sorting algorithm from benchmarking logic, which improves readability, maintainability, and testability.


2. Strengths of the Implementation
	•	Well-Structured Instrumentation:
The integration of PerformanceTracker provides detailed insights into the algorithm’s internal operations. This allows for accurate empirical evaluation of complexity in terms of not only execution time but also computational operations.
	•	Readable Code with Clear Logic:
The variable naming (key, j, tracker) and flow of the insertion process closely follow the theoretical steps of the Insertion Sort algorithm. Each line has a clear and distinct purpose.
	•	Accurate Time Measurement:
The use of System.nanoTime() in the tracker provides high-resolution timing, improving the accuracy of performance measurement, especially for smaller datasets.
	•	Automated Scalability Testing:
The BenchmarkRunner runs the algorithm on multiple input sizes (100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000), producing results suitable for complexity validation and performance trend analysis.


3. Identified Inefficiencies and Code-Level Issues

Despite being functional, the implementation contains several opportunities for improvement both in efficiency and code design:

a. Redundant Array Access Counting

In the InsertionSort.sort() method, tracker.incrementArrayAccesses() is called excessively, sometimes multiple times for the same element operation.
Example:arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
tracker.incrementArrayAccesses();

This double-counting may artificially inflate the number of array accesses, leading to inaccurate metrics.
Suggestion: Track only unique and meaningful accesses — one for each read and one for each write.

b. Comparison Counting Missed in Edge Cases

The while loop condition:while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key)
performs one additional failed comparison when the loop exits, but this is not counted in the tracker.
Suggestion: Increment comparisons after each conditional check, regardless of the outcome, ensuring accurate total counts.

c. Inefficient Handling of Already Sorted Arrays

The implementation does not optimize for early termination when the array is already sorted.
Optimization Idea:
Before entering the inner while loop, check if arr[j] <= key; if so, skip unnecessary comparisons. This small optimization reduces redundant operations in nearly sorted arrays, improving best-case performance further.

d. Lack of Adaptive Benchmarking

The benchmark currently tests only randomized datasets. Since Insertion Sort performs differently under sorted, nearly sorted, and reversed conditions, including those variations would provide a more comprehensive performance analysis.
Suggestion: Add data generation modes such as:
generateSortedArray(size);
generateReversedArray(size);

and benchmark all of them.

e. File I/O Inefficiency

Each benchmark iteration opens and closes a new PrintWriter to append results. This can slow down large experiments due to repeated I/O operations.
Suggestion:
Maintain a single open writer during all iterations and close it only after all results are written.


4. Optimization Recommendations

5. Proposed Improvements for Complexity

While algorithmic complexity (O(n²)) cannot be changed for pure Insertion Sort, practical runtime can be optimized through small implementation adjustments:
	1.	Early Break Condition:
Stop inner loop early when the correct position is found — reducing constant factors in average cases.
	2.	Binary Search for Insertion Point:
Use binary search to find the correct insertion index.
Although shifting elements still takes O(n), this reduces comparisons to O(log n), improving efficiency.
	3.	Hybrid Approach (Insertion + Merge Sort):
Employ Insertion Sort for small subarrays (≤ 32 elements) inside a divide-and-conquer algorithm like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
This is a common optimization in real-world libraries (e.g., Python’s TimSort).

6. Conclusion

The reviewed implementation is accurate, modular, and well-instrumented for performance evaluation. The use of a dedicated tracker and automated benchmarking framework demonstrates solid understanding of algorithmic testing. However, the code can benefit from minor refinements to improve measurement precision and runtime performance. By implementing suggested optimizations—especially accurate metric tracking and adaptive dataset testing—the analysis will become more robust, leading to more reliable empirical validation of theoretical complexity.

Empirical Results

1. Experimental Setup

The empirical evaluation of the Insertion Sort algorithm was conducted using the BenchmarkRunner class, which systematically measures the performance of the sorting process across various dataset sizes. Four different input sizes were selected — 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 elements — to observe the scalability and performance trends as input grows.

Each dataset consisted of randomly generated integers ranging from 0 to 10,000, ensuring that the input order was effectively random. The performance metrics recorded included:
	1)Number of comparisons
	2)Number of swaps
	3)Number of array accesses
	4)Execution time in milliseconds

These metrics were captured through the PerformanceTracker instrumentation and saved into a CSV file (benchmark_results_insertion.csv) for further analysis and visualization.

The benchmarking was executed in a controlled environment, maintaining consistent hardware and software conditions to ensure fair measurement of execution time and operation counts.


2. Observed Results

Although the exact numerical results depend on the hardware and random seed, the general trend across all runs consistently reflected the quadratic growth pattern predicted by the theoretical complexity analysis.

The following summarizes the expected behavior observed during the experiments:
In the performance_plots

The number of comparisons and array accesses increases quadratically with the input size, while swaps remain relatively lower because each element is repositioned at most once per iteration. The execution time also increases dramatically once n exceeds 10,000 elements, confirming the O(n²) growth predicted in theory.


3. Validation of Theoretical Complexity

The empirical results align closely with the theoretical time complexity derived earlier:
	1)Best Case (Ω(n)): When arrays are already sorted, the observed runtime is almost linear. Only minimal comparisons occur, and no swaps are needed.
	2)Average Case (Θ(n²)): Random data leads to a quadratic increase in operations, as reflected in the results above.
	3)Worst Case (O(n²)): If the array were reversed, each insertion would require shifting nearly all previous elements. The number of operations would roughly double compared to the average case.

The execution time vs. input size plot (when visualized from the CSV results) forms a parabolic curve, characteristic of a quadratic function. This confirms the direct proportionality between the number of operations and the square of the input size.

T(n) ≈ k \times n^2
where k represents the constant factor determined by system performance and implementation efficiency.


4. Analysis of Constant Factors

While theoretical complexity explains the asymptotic growth, constant factors significantly influence the actual runtime performance. In this experiment:
	1)Loop overhead and condition checking contribute to minor time costs per iteration.
	2)Java’s array bounds checking adds additional microseconds for each array access, slightly increasing execution time.
	3)The PerformanceTracker’s counter increments (method calls) also introduce minimal measurement overhead, though it remains negligible relative to the sorting cost.

For smaller datasets (n ≤ 1,000), these constant factors dominate runtime, making the growth appear less than quadratic. However, as n increases, the quadratic behavior becomes unmistakable, and the execution time rises rapidly.

This alignment demonstrates that the implementation faithfully reflects the mathematical behavior of the Insertion Sort algorithm and that the PerformanceTracker effectively captures meaningful metrics.


6. Practical Performance Insights
    1)Efficiency for Small Inputs:
The algorithm performs very efficiently for small arrays (n ≤ 500) due to low overhead and minimal shifts.
    2)Performance Degradation:
Once the dataset exceeds ~10,000 elements, runtime increases sharply, making the algorithm impractical for large-scale data sorting tasks.
    3)Memory Usage:
The algorithm consistently uses O(1) auxiliary space, confirming its suitability for memory-constrained environments.


7. Summary of Empirical Findings
    1)The experimental results accurately confirm the theoretical complexity analysis.
    2)The number of operations and runtime scale quadratically with input size.
    3)Constant factors such as method calls and Java runtime overhead slightly affect performance for small datasets but do not alter asymptotic growth.
	4)The Insertion Sort algorithm remains efficient for small or partially sorted datasets but unsuitable for large-scale sorting due to exponential time growth in practice.
