SELECTION SORT ANALYSIS

Time Complexity:

Best Case:  — when the array is already sorted.

Average and Worst Case:  — when the array is random or reversed.


Number of Comparisons: 

In the worst case, every element needs to be compared with the others in the sorted portion of the array.


Number of Swaps: 

At most, each element will be swapped once, resulting in  swaps.


Number of Array Accesses: 

Each comparison and shift operation requires array accesses, leading to quadratic complexity in the worst case.


Conclusion: Insertion Sort is efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets, as its best-case time complexity is . However, its average and worst-case performance degrade to , making it unsuitable for large datasets.
