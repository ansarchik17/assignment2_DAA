Algorithm Overview: Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by dividing the list into two parts — a sorted section and an unsorted section. Initially, the sorted section contains only the first element of the array, and with each iteration, the algorithm takes the next element from the unsorted section and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted portion. This process continues until all elements have been placed correctly.

The logic behind Insertion Sort is similar to the way humans arrange playing cards in their hands: start with an empty hand (the sorted section) and insert each new card (element) into its proper place by comparing it with the cards already held.

Formally, given an array A of size n, the algorithm iterates from the second element (i = 1) to the last element (i = n−1). For each element, it stores the value temporarily (key = A[i]) and compares it with the previous elements. If a larger element is found, it is shifted one position to the right to make space for the key. The key is then inserted into its correct sorted position.

While Insertion Sort is not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, it has important educational and practical value. It is adaptive, performing efficiently on small or nearly sorted data, and stable, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements. Its in-place nature also ensures low memory usage, as it does not require additional data structures beyond a few variables.

Insertion Sort’s straightforward logic makes it a common choice for teaching the fundamentals of sorting algorithms and algorithmic thinking. Moreover, it is often used as a subroutine within more complex algorithms such as Hybrid Sorts (e.g., TimSort) for optimizing performance on small partitions of data.
